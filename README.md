# JavaChess
A chess made in java as a study excercise
#Movement
A2 will refer to the left most white pawn, and to move it 1 place forward you will have to write "A2-A3".
There is no error handling for outside of range letters so W1-W2 would result in an error.
#Change Piece
When your pawn reaches the opponents first row a "What would you like to change it to?" message will be displayed and you need to type in the piece you want.
IMPORTANT: the name should start with a capital letter ex: Rook.
The asked for piece cannot be King or Pawn, if the player asks for either the move won't happen and they have to retype the move and ask for a valid piece.
